tabulator
=========

Web and Android app for settling bills among groups.

This is an Ionic framework app. To build it yourself

1. Install Ionic including the command line utility ionic
2. ionic start Tabulator
3. Overwrite files in the project with files from this repo
4. Fix .gitignore up

I may invent a more elegant way sometime.
